# Iterative Prompt Development
![Iterative](/Iterative.png)

Starts from Idea-> Implementation (code/data) Prompt -> Experimental result -> Error analysis -> Idea

## Issues during Iterative Prompt Development
- Issue 1: The text is too long.
    - Limit the number of words/sentences/characters.

- Issue 2: Text focuses on the wrong details. 
    - Ask it to focus on the aspects that are relevant to the intended audience.

- Issue 3. Description needs a table of dimensions. 
    - Ask it to extract information and organize it in a table.

### Iterative Process
- Try something.
- Analyse where the result does not give what you want. 
- Clarify instructions, give more time to think.
- Refine prompts with a batch of examples.
